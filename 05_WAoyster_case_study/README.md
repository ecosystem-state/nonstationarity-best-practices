# 05_WAoyster_case_study

We considered a fourth case study that was not ultimately included in this analysis as we determined the interpretation was similar to the GoA salmon case study, but that case study offered a clearer illustration. Here we provide the scripts for processing and exploring the raw data "01_oyster_dfa.R" with the raw data contained in the data folder, and the exploratory linear models and GAMs that were considered which are in "02_wa.oystercondition.qmd"
